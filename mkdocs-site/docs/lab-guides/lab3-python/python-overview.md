# Lab 3: Python

![Python](../../assets/images/image039.png)

Python is widely used for network and infrastructure automation because it is simple, readable, and easy to learn. Its clear syntax lets engineers focus on automation logic rather than language complexity, making it well suited for fast-paced lab environments.

In automation workflows, Python often complements declarative tools like Terraform and Ansible. It is commonly used for tasks such as validation, generating inputs, verification, and cleanup—areas that are harder to express using declarative models alone.

Python’s rich ecosystem of libraries makes it easy to interact directly with APIs, controllers, and platforms such as Cisco ACI and Nexus Dashboard. This flexibility and broad support make Python a core tool in real-world network automation:

- [Cisco ACI Python SDK Documentation](https://cobra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Devnet Python ACI Examples](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/CiscoDevNet/python_code_samples_network/)
- [Github Python ACI Examples)](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/aci-learning-labs-code-samples)

## Why Python for ACI Automation?

- **Flexibility** - Full programming capabilities for complex logic
- **Integration** - Easy to integrate with other systems and tools
- **Cisco Support** - Official Cobra SDK from Cisco
- **Scripting** - Quick one-off tasks and automation
- **Community** - Large ecosystem of libraries and examples
