```bash
python --version
```

- Install the requests library (if not already installed):
pip install requests

```bash
pip install requests
```

![Pip](../../assets/images/image020.png)

- Locate the Python script: Open Explorer from the Taskbar, navigate to the Demouser folder, then Python folder, and open the **‘rocev2qos.py’** Python File in Visual Studio Code (or Notepad++) to view its content:

- The Python Code can now be viewed including # comments describing the script. Please refer to Appendix B to review the Python Script at greater detail:

Proceed to [Execute Script](execute-script.md) to create a Python script that applies the QoS policies to both APIC controllers.
